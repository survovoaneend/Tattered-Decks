# Tattered Decks
Tattered Decks are B-side versions of all 15 decks that aim to be more complicated/advanced than their counterpart. Only Tattered Red is avaliable right now. 

Some decks have gimmicks that make certain Jokers/Vouchers either completely busted or completely useless, so some of them have been reworked to maintain balance. (this is also why I strongly caution against using this with other content mods)

THIS IS VERY WIP, I just needed to put up this repo so people can play what's out right now. I know the button placement is weird. I know the menu switch is weird. I'll fix it eventually I promise.
